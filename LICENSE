Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2025 Stepan Bezhuk
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free softwareâ€”to make sure the software is free for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of "free" as in "free speech," not as in "free beer."

This license, the GPL, applies to software or other works that you modify or distribute under its terms. When you use or distribute software under this license, you are required to offer recipients the same freedoms you received, including access to the source code and the right to modify it.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. You may copy, distribute, and modify the Software, as long as you meet the following conditions:
   - You must provide a copy of this license with every distribution of the Software.
   - You must make the source code available when distributing the Software in binary form or modify it.

2. If you modify the Software and distribute it, you must provide a prominent notice stating that you have changed the Software.

3. You are not allowed to use the name of the copyright holder or the name of the Software to promote derived works.

4. The Software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the copyright holder or any contributor be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages arising in any way out of the use of the Software, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

5. You must ensure that any modification of the Software meets the conditions of this license, including making the modified source code available.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
